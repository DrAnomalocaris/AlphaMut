WARNING: You are welcome to use the default MSA server, however keep in mind that it's a
limited shared resource only capable of processing a few thousand MSAs per day. Please
submit jobs only from a single IP address. We reserve the right to limit access to the
server case-by-case when usage exceeds fair use. If you require more MSAs: You can 
precompute all MSAs with `colabfold_search` or host your own API and pass it to `--host-url`
