{"HMHB1": "This gene encodes one of the minor histocompatibility antigens, which play an important role in the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) reactivity against leukemia after human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This gene is only expressed in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells. The translation of this mRNA initiates at a non-AUG (CUG) codon.
